# twangle
Mangles the profile photo of a certain twitter account

# Dependencies
This uses the `wand` library, so you may need to install imagemagick if you don't have it already. I should really check that. 
Also you need all the dependencies in the Pipfile... but just use pipenv and you never need to check those

# Usage
Pls use pipenv and ```pipenv install``` instead of setting up dependencies like a fool

Then run ```pipenv run python twangle.py <mangle amt> <twitter screen name>```

The output file will be saved to the main directory

have fun!
